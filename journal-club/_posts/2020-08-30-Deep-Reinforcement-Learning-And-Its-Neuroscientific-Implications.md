**Abstract:** What if a machine could mimic the way a human learns? Sounds pretty ambitious right? Reinforcement Learning is one of the three paradigms of Machine Learning that can be used for this purpose. In this, there is a single task to be accomplished and the machine looks for the most optimal path to solve the task along with maximising the cumulative reward. Does it sound similar? It seems like a person learning from his/her mistakes. It has a very subtle closeness to human learning and its neuroscientific implications has been focused on in the event. <br>
