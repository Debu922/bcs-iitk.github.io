  about: I am an electrical engineering undergraduate student. My true passion is understanding emotions, how they work, and how the brain implements them. I like the challenge of unfolding various intertwined cognitive processes that take place in the background of human reactions when they feel a certain emotion. I enjoy socializing and digging up stories of people around me. In my leisure time, I honestly love to read or munch on loads of fast food and watch TV shows.

  about: I am a third-year Undergraduate at BSBE and I am interested in temporal aspects of Neural Coding and how itâ€™s influenced by our current mood. In the future, I hope to contribute towards ongoing efforts to develop a complete connectome of the human brain that can replicate human emotions and behavior. My hobbies include pretty much anything I can get my hands on, cooking, reading, and listening to music are my favorites.
