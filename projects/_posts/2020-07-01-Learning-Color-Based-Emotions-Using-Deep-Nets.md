title: Learning Color-Based Emotions Using Deep-Nets
abstract: The project involved designing an experiment to collect human-judgement data, mapping images (and words) to one out of five colors following the underlying emotion behind them. The aim was to see if popular pre-trained image-classification models such as VGG-16, ResNET, NasNET show any similarity between the images and the color images, as seen in the data collected.

The project involved designing an experiment to collect human-judgement data, mapping images (and words) to one out of five colors following the underlying emotion behind them. The aim was to see if popular pre-trained image-classification models such as VGG-16, ResNET, NasNET show any similarity between the images and the color images, as seen in the data collected. 

For this, we extracted features from different layers of the CNNs and calculated similarity values (cosine similarity) for all the images and the five color images. And further, following previous research on similarity predictions, we trained the data on a representation of the extracted features to predict probabilities of selecting a particular color. Applying cross validation to get predictions for all images, R values with the experimental data were found out to be as high as 0.6 for a few particular models, which shows a strong correlation.
Hence we were able to see the underlying emotion-based mapping between images and color-images.

Feedback: 
"This was a great opportunity to apply machine learning (neural network) concepts to real data. I learnt a lot, in every step. I was kept motivated and encouraged throughout the duration of the project. I loved working with BCS and would love to try doing more projects based on machine learning applications in the future."
