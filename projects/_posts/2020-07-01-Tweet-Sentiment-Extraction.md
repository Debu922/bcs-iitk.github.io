Feedback:
"I learnt a ton of new things during this project. This was my first project under Snt Council. My mentor and team-mates helped me a lot and guided me. Before this project my knowledge of NLP/TSE/ML was very less. Now I have got a good experience on NLP/TSE/ML. After doing this project, I have developed interest in these fields of study and now I want to explore them more." - Saad Ahmad
