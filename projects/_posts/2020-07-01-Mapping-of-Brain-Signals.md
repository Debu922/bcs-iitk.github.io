title: Mapping of Brain Signals
abstract: To understand the working, function and to some extent, the structure of the brain specifically so, by using empathy for pain to target Bilateral Anterior Insula and Anterior Cingulate Cortex using external stimuli.To study Brain activity and function using EEG data, learn how to analyse this data and explore the reason behind certain behaviour as we know it.

The project aims to fulfill its objective through a research study:<br>
"*To find the effect of acetaminophen in empathy and social decision-making.*"

The goals hence, can be outlined as:
* Understand the concept of empathy for pain and in this pursuit monitor and understand brain functionality to a certain aspect.
* Learn EEG data processing and analysis using the EEGLAB toolbox of MATLAB.
* Generalise and work towards automating the process of filtering EEG data.
* Study, record, process, observe, analyse, discuss and present results obtained from the research study by implementing everything learnt to organic data.
* Compile results and derive a comprehensible conclusion.

Feedback: "The project made way to develop insights into a plethora of novel concepts and ideas which sparked curiosity and nurtured the interest and fascination we had while taking up this project. Weekly meetings, assigned work and a flexibility to execute our own ideas was a highlight. We had the opportunity to work with something completely new and incorporate the professorâ€™s ideas and vision and though, we could not reach its culmination, at the end of the day we walked out with an amazing experience." - Saksham Pruthi
