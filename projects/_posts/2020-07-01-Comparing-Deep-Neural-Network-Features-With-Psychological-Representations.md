title: Comparing Deep Neural Network Features With Psychological Representations
abstract: In this project, we are replicating the work of Peterson et al 2016, testing using other state-of-the-art models and testing the method with different changes to testify if the method is really adapting to psychological representations.

Peterson et al 2016 attempted to evaluate the relation between deep representations and mental representations for making similarity judgments and see how well the former aligns with the latter. The similarity judgments, in turn, are calculated by taking a weighted inner product of the feature representations of the two objects. Results from the paper revealed that comparatively much better results were obtained when the weights were calculated using a regression technique rather than when they were considered to be constant unity. This seems to produce very favorable results and would indicate that deep learned representations can represent psychological representations. In this project, we are trying to test whether this really is this case. We start off by replicating their work, testing using other state-of-the-art models, and testing the method with different changes to testify if the method is really adapting to psychological representations. Apart from this, we have also designed a similar experiment in the NLP domain.

Feedback: "This was my first Deep Learning project and it has cultivated a great interest for me in this field. I will definitely be looking forward to doing more DL/ML projects. The mentoring for this project was excellent and the guidance has helped us grow and even win the ‘Best Research Award’ in SnT Summer Camp ‘20. Very positively looking forward to doing projects with BCS again." - Amartya Dash
